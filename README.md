# ArchData
A Data Availability Project 

We have collected here links to a number of archaeological datasets along with the code to easily access them in R.  You will not find data here (unles it is our own), but rather pointers to data and methods for easily pulling these data into your projects.  Our idea is to recreate a decentralized archaeological database.  We hope that this will be a valuable resource for researchers looking for comparative data, for teachers looking for example datasets, and for students looking to develop their data analysis skills.

If you have contributions to add please either contact us or get involved via Git.
